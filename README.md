Microscope Light Source
=======================

A simple PWM capable constant current source for a high brightness LED
based around an ATtiny13 and an LM317 voltage regulator. 

The board has been designed to be primarily one-sided, it should be
possible to etch it DIY. This hasn't been tested though. The top copper
layer only has a ground fill and the extra unused pins brought out to
pads for possible use at a later date.
